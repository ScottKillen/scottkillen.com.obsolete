Break me.

Put me on my knees,<br />
where I can find that life<br />
is not about me.

Break me.

Show me that life<br />
can suffer a bruising<br />
and get back up.

Break me.

Mold me into<br />
the sculpture I can be<br />
from the lump I am.

Break me.

Show me the beauty of friendship,<br />
hands grasping mine,<br />
pulling me up.

Break me.

Let me grow beyond<br />
the shell of myself,<br />
rising to heights unseen.

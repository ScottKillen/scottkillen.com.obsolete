I sit beneath Your radiance, <br />
oblivious to life <br />
except where the shadows end.<br />

You light my path, <br />
the sun dead by comparison. <br />
My feet find purchase.<br />

I remember the darkness, <br />
life before You, <br />
the vestigial wisp of night.<br />

I am warm. <br />
My soul fills itself <br />
with Your refulgent song.<br />

Love, the abiding tree <br />
basks in Your glow, <br />
full of healing fruit that is ever ripe.<br />

The moon dances with the sun <br />
circling in orbit, <br />
learning Your lessons.<br />

I am enthralled by Your light, <br />
examining, searching, <br />
knowing it will quell every doubt.<br />

You are my daydream, <br />
lighting my life, <br />
washing the shadows away.

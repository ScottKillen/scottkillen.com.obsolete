Morning mist whispers <br />
waiting for dawn, <br />
gather together in earnest. <br />

Birds sing sparsely, <br />
tuning instruments, <br />
awaiting conductor's cues. <br />

Solemn trees bestir, <br />
rousing from slumber, <br />
uprooting forest dreams. <br />

Flowers turn, <br />
seeking truth, <br />
searching for life renewed. <br />

Apropos Sun emerges from shadow, <br />
ringing joy's bell, <br />
new day begins brighter still. <br />

Welcome to my blog. I try my best to make sure that the discussions on
my posts are troll, spam, and abuse free, but I am just a man. The
comment section can be a great place for expressing yourself,
interaction with others, and even for engaging in stimulating
conversation. To ensure that you have a good time here, please make sure
to stick to the following guidelines:

- Be polite---don't be rude to anyone and respect others. If something
  you would say would get you upset, please don't say it here. Remember
  you are communicating with a person not a screen and words hurt
  people.
- Obscenities are not allowed. Obscenities are a lazy way to express
  yourself. Please take a few more minutes to think about what you really
  want to say.
- Don't troll. I appreciate and welcome criticism here, but comments
  adding nothing but insult to the discussion will be deleted without
  exception.
- Spam? It's OK as a protein, but not allowed here.

To put is simply, these guidelines boil down to "Be decent. Seek to
elevate others."

If you find any comment which violates these guidelines, please make
sure to 'flag' them. Remember, I am just a man---I appreciate your
help!
